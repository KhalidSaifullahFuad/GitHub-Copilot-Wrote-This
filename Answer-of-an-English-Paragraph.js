// Read the passage and answer the following questions
/*
When we go and watch a movie in the cinema, we see real people moving and talking on a big screen in front of us. But how are movies filmed and shown to us? In actual fact, movies do not really `move' like we think they do. It is our eyes that play tricks on us and make the movies look as if they are moving.
A movie is filmed using a camera which takes pictures at a very fast speed. The camera can take 24 pictures in one second! If it is taking pictures of somebody walking, the pictures will show the different movements of the person in that one second. Since the pictures are taken so quickly, the difference between each picture is very slight.
The pictures are developed into long strips of film which are then shown, using a film projector. As we watch, 24 pictures flash before our eyes every second. The pictures go by so fast that we cannot see each one by itself. What we see is just one picture that seems to move. Our eyes play a part by blending the pictures with each other.
In present time, special cameras like IMAX or 3D cameras are being used for magnificent shooting quality. Normal theaters cannot play an IMAX or 3D movie like they can easily play a 2D movie.

The same method applies to cartoons. In a cartoon, instead of taking pictures of real people, the camera takes pictures of drawings. Many drawings have to be made just to show a simple action. Each drawing is again made only slightly different from the others. The drawings are then photographed orderly. When everything is complete and the cartoon is shown, it also looks as though the characters are really moving.
